# Time Complexity:
# Counting Frequencies: O(n), where ùëõ is the number of words.
# Heap Operations:Building the heap takes O(m), where m is the number of unique words. Extracting the top k elements takes O(klogm).
# Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n+m+klogm), which is efficient for large inputs.
    

# Space Complexity:
# Counter and Heap: Storing word frequencies and heap elements requires O(m) space.
# Result List: The result list for the top k words requires O(k) space.
# So, the overall space complexity is O(m+k).
